In this documentation, we describe all the products built by WandX, how the community can use these products, as well as how different players in the crypto space can use our products. This is done through tutorials, SDK and API documentation. Navigation Getting Started : The objective of this documentation is to create an open source repository for developers and companies to be able to use the various products built by WandX to further their development goals. These products include: A decentralized exchange built on the NEO Blockchain, AION Blockchain, Wanchain Blockchain. We have SDKs and APIs that enables any existing exchange or upcoming exchange to integrate our decentralized exchange on any of the above Blockchains in less than a few hours. We have built a micro-app that enables any token based website to enable their users to trade their Token within their website itself. The custom Basket Protocol that enables users to trade in portfolios of Tokens on either the Ethereum Blockchain, NEO Blockchain, AION Blockchain, Wanchain Blockchain. This protocol can be applied in various ways: a. To enable users to hedge their portfolios, to buy into a Basket of say exchange Tokens. b. To build a decentralized ETF kind of application. c. To trade in large amounts of a single Token, entirely peer to peer, without affecting the price of the Token. The Tokens can be ERC20 Tokens, WRC20 Tokens, ATS Tokens, or NEP5 Tokens. We have built backend infrastructure for the AION, Wanchain, NEO, EOS Blockchains to make it easy for any Dapp developers to be able to develop on any of these Blockchains. Dapp developers do not need to worry about connecting to the Blockchain, making calls to the Blockchain etc. All that would be taken care of by the infra that we've built. Tutorials : Watch some our video tutorials, as well as go through our tutorial documentation to integrate our Basket Protocol into your application, our DEX into your exchange, or use our infrastructure built for AION, Wanchain, EOS, NEO to be able to build Dapps seamlessly on these Blockchains. Project Ideas : We'd be very interested to collaborate with projects building on our protocol, infrastructure, or on our DEX. Those interested to collaborate outside of our platform, but feel that the collaboration would be mutually beneficial, do fill out this form and we'll get in touch with you shortly. Smart Contracts : All our smart contracts built on Ethereum, NEO, AION, Wanchain can be seen on our Github Integrations : Users, developers, projects can integrate our protocol and architecture into their products. Additional Resources : Users can see additional resources over on our website and Blog Support and Community If you have any questions about WandX, you can get direct access to our team and other members of the community through Slack and Telegram. We are looking for integration partners to build on and expand WandX.

Trading Protocol WandX has successfully launched a protocol that allows users to create and trade baskets of ERC20 tokens through smart contracts. Baskets are customized bundles of ERC20 tokens, specified by the user. For example, as an owner of these tokens, I could create a Basket of 100 EOS, 1000 KIN and 100 LRC on a smart contract. With the creation of this Basket, I would now be the owner of the smart contract that contains these tokens. Once created, I can then list the Basket for trade for an ask price, for example 2 ETH, which is posted on the already established smart contract. Once listed, another person or entity can assume ownership of this Token Basket by sending 2 ETH to that basket address. The Basket originator then receives the 2 ETH through the smart contract, while the person who sent the 2 ETH is the new owner of the basket. In this way, WandX has created a fully decentralized mechanism of creating trading ERC20 Token Baskets. The Token baskets can be integrated into any exchange or wallet that allows sign in through a users\u2019 private key, and subsequently executed by any wallet or exchange. Example Basket Transaction Let\u2019s better define how this transaction might work today Seller (and owner) of tokens defines and publishes basket Underlying tokens are deposited onto the smart contract which is still to this point owned by the Seller Buyer purchases basket using Ether Smart contract is executed Buyer gets the basket and thus ownership of the underlying tokens Seller gets the ether Buy Create a buy order Update or Cancel Buy Order Fill Order Sell Create a sell order Update or Cancel sell Order Fill Order","title":"Basket Protocol"},{"location":"basketprotocol/#basket-protocol","text":"Using the WandX Basket protocol to enable creation of Baskets of ERC20 or ERC223 Tokens, to enable trading a large amount of a single Token entirely peer to peer through a single transaction without affecting the price of the Token as there wouldn't be any API through which the price is determined.","title":"Basket Protocol"},{"location":"basketprotocol/#trading-protocol","text":"WandX has successfully launched a protocol that allows users to create and trade baskets of ERC20 tokens through smart contracts.

The Basket protocol , created by the WandX team, enables users to create baskets of ERC20 Tokens and group them into a single unit which is stored on a smart contract. This document focuses on how exchanges can use the Basket protocol to offer Token Baskets to their customers. Initially, the exchange ( let's call it the ABC Exchange) needs to register with WandX and sign the needed documents. This can be done through an email interaction with abhinav.ramesh@wandx.co. After the agreement, the ABC Exchange will be a part of the Basket protocol. Whenever a User comes to the WandX platform and trades, they have the flexibility to create a Basket of tokens. Once the User create this basket, this basket is pushed onto the Basket Storage Contract. There is a two way communication between the Basket Storage Contract and the WandX platform, which means data gets updated every now and then on the Basket Storage Contract. As a part of this Basket protocol, the ABC Exchange has the flexibility to choose any of these Baskets from the Basket Storage Contract and trade these Baskets on their platform. Now users can come onto the ABC Exchange and purchase these Basket of tokens. Once the transaction is complete, the exchange profit fee goes to Exchange Wallet which is controlled by the WandX team. From this Exchange Wallet, exchange profit fee goes to Fee Distributor Contract which is owned by the WandX team, where the fee breaks down according to the Agreements signed between the ABC Exchange and Basket protocol and gets transferred to the ABC Exchange. All transactions happening during the process can be visible on Etherscan. Step 1 ABC exchange sends an integration request to the Basket protocol. Step 2 ABC Exchange will discuss and agree upon the terms and conditions related to the Basket protocol , with the WandX Team. The following details should be shared and agreed upon: Fee split ratio Frequency at which fee transfers should happen between WandX Team and ABC Exchange ABC Exchange address on the Etherscan. (Fees will be transferred to this address) Storage Contract address (WandX team will share this) Basket contract ABI (WandX team will share this) Code to extract the list of active Baskets from the Storage (From the contract shared above) Code to execute or call, Basket buy or trade methods Step 3 WandX Team will set up the ABC Exchange integration with the Basket protocol. Step 4 After the integration with Basket protocol, the ABC Exchange can extract and display the list of Baskets on their Exchange using the code shared in step 2. Step 5 ((only through the WandX platform)) The WandX Team can make Basket updates if any, and can push them onto the Basket Storage Contract. New Baskets can be published as and when users create them on the WandX platform. Step 6 Individual exchanges can build their own Basket interaction UI for all the methods like publish, update, cancel, buy, deposit, withdraw, buy. These methods are available for the Baskets that are created on WandX. The UI for these methods can be provided by WandX, and customized for each exchange. The ABI as shared in Step 2 will have the mandatory details to build this UI and interactions, the code for which is available only for buy or trade method interactions. Step 7 (new Basket creation) New Baskets can only be created on the WandX platform. Step 8 When a user tries to buy a Basket on an exchange, that exchange address (shared with the WandX Team in step 2) needs to be injected as a parameter into the Buy method. This address is mandatory to claim the Exchange trade fee. Refer the code shared in step 2. Step 9 When a buy transaction on ABC Exchange is executed successfully, the calculated Fees will be transferred into the Exchange Wallet (WandX team controls the Exchange Wallet). Step 10 When a buy transaction is executed successfully, the details like Basket ID, exchange address, trade fee will be available through events in the transaction. Anyone can go to etherscan and verify the transaction details and fee collection details. A transaction parsing job will be running in the background which identifies and processes the Basket related transactions, extracts the fee related details and generates/updates the Fee Collection Table (WandX Team controls this and will be shared with other exchanges on need basis). Step 11 Fee Distribution job will run on a weekly/monthly basis, and transferring of funds will happen as recorded in the fee table. Funds will be transferred to the Exchange account which has been shared in step 2.","title":"Basket Protocol Integration"},{"location":"basketprotocolintegration/#basket-protocol-integration","text":"Integration of the Basket protocol with Exchanges Above architecture describes the integration of the Basket protocol with exchanges.

WandX decentralized exchange is an exchange market that does not rely on a third party service to hold the customer's funds. Instead, trades occur directly between users (peer to peer) through an automated process. This system can be achieved by creating proxy tokens (crypto assets that represent a certain fiat or crypto currency) or assets (that can represent shares in a company for example) or through a decentralized multi-signature escrow system, among other solutions that are currently being developed. This system contrasts with the current centralized model in which users deposit their funds and the exchange issues an IOU that can be freely traded on the platform. When a user asks to withdraw his funds, these are converted back into the cryptocurrency they represent and sent to their owner. Benefits The most obvious benefit to using a decentralized exchange over a centralized one is their \"trustless\" nature. You are not required to trust the security or honesty of the exchange since the funds are held by you in your personal wallet and not by a third party. Another advantage to the decentralized model is the privacy it provides. Users are not required to disclose their personal details to anyone, except if the exchange method involves bank transfers, in which case your identity is revealed only to the person that is selling or buying from you. Furthermore, the hosting of decentralized exchanges is distributed through nodes meaning that there is no risk of server downtime.

In the ERC20 standard, each token has a base unit that is defined by its decimals property. For example, a WnadX token\u2019s decimals is 18, meaning its base unit is 10 ** -18 of one WnadX. Intuitively, it makes sense to tie a certain amount of a component\u2018s base unit to one WnadX token to calculate the component allocation of the WnadX. However, this becomes problematic when a component token has a significantly lower decimals value than a WnadX. Take for example Airswap (AST), which uses only 4 decimal places, this makes their token far less divisible. As a consequence, say we want to issue 10 ** 13 of a WnadX that contains AST, there\u2018s a chance that the issuance would require transferring partial amounts of an AST base unit, which is not possible, and thus would leave the WnadX token undercollateralized. To combat this problem, instead of tying component base unit amounts to one WnadX Token, we can tie the component base unit amounts to some quantity of WnadX token base units. This is what the natural unit of a WnadX is for: it defines the amount of WnadX token base units to tie component token amounts to. In order to make this work there is a lower bound on what the natural unit can be, which is 10 ** (18 - minimumDecimal) where minimumDecimal is the lowest decimal value of the component tokens comprising the WnadX. Furthermore in order to avoid rounding errors in issuance and redemption, all issue and redeem quantities must be multiples of the natural unit. For a more thorough treatment, including an example, see section 5.2.1 of our White Paper .
